# KT Volume Profile MT5 ReadMe

This ReadMe file provides an overview of the code for the KT Volume Profile MT5 indicator. The indicator calculates the volume profile data and displays it on the chart. It also identifies the Point of Control (POC), which represents the price level with the highest trading volume.

## Developer Information

- Developer: Forex Robot Easy Team
- Website: [forexroboteasy.com](https://forexroboteasy.com)

## Global Variables

- `startTime`: Start time for volume profile calculation
- `endTime`: End time for volume profile calculation
- `pocIndex`: Index of the Point of Control (POC)

## Custom Indicator Functions

### `OnInit()`

- Initializes global variables.
- Returns `INIT_SUCCEEDED` to indicate successful initialization.

### `OnDeinit(const int reason)`

- Performs necessary cleanup or actions before indicator deinitialization.
- This function can be customized as per requirements.

### `OnCalculate(const int rates_total, const int prev_calculated, const datetime &time[], const double &open[], const double &high[], const double &low[], const double &close[], const long &tick_volume[], const long &volume[], const int &spread[])`

- Calculates the volume profile data and displays it on the chart.
- Identifies the Point of Control (POC) as the price level with the highest trading volume.
- Displays volume accumulation data on the y-axis.
- Displays trading activity over specific time periods and price levels.
- Displays the Point of Control (POC) as a support/resistance level.
- Returns `rates_total` to indicate the number of calculated bars.

## How it Works

1. The indicator checks if volume profile calculation is required by checking if `startTime` and `endTime` variables are set.
2. If not set, it calculates `startTime` as the previous minute and `endTime` as the current minute.
3. It then calculates the volume profile data by accumulating volume within the specified time range and resetting volume outside the range.
4. The Point of Control (POC) is determined as the price level with the highest trading volume.
5. The indicator displays volume accumulation data on the y-axis by calculating the maximum and minimum volume values and dividing the range into 10 steps.
6. It displays trading activity over specific time periods and price levels.
7. Finally, it displays the POC as a support/resistance level on the chart.
